# Sentiment-Classification-of-Twitter-Data-Labelled-
The task for this problem set was to analyze & classify an twitter dataset consisting of 37,041 tweets into five different sentiment categories. We were needed to build a model 
that can classify those tweet texts into five categories namely Extremely negative (represented by label ‘0’), Negative (represented by label ‘1’), Neutral (represented by label 
‘2’), Positive (represented by label ‘3’) & Extremely Positive (represented by label ‘4’), in order to get a perception of the epidemiological situation in various regions.
